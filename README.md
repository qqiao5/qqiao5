## 👋 Hi there! I'm an aspiring data scientist.

I’m passionate about using data to solve real-world problems. With a strong background in Python and statistics, I enjoy working on projects that combine machine learning, data visualization, and practical impact.

---

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- Building and deploying ML models with **FastAPI**, **Docker**, and **MLflow**
- Developing ETL pipelines using **SQL**, **Airflow**, and **cloud tools** like BigQuery

---

### 🧠 Skills I'm Developing
- **ModelOps (MLOps):** Learning how to move models from notebooks to production
- **Data Engineering:** Working with real-world workflows, orchestration, and optimization

---

### 📌 Goals for GitHub
- Improve README files and documentation for clarity
- Add more visualizations and interactive dashboards (e.g., Streamlit)
- Pin top projects that showcase a full end-to-end workflow
